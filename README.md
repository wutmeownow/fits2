User_fit.ipynb : starter code and example for fitting an arbitrary function with ROOT

Scipy_fit.ipynb : starter code and example for fitting an arbitrary function with scipy.optimize

fit_user.C : demo code for making a user-defined fitting function in ROOT.  Poorly choosen starting parameters selected here will prevent the minimizer from converging.<br>
data1.root : created with fit_user.C 

datadist.root : contains a hisogram "h" that should be fit using a function of your own choosing
